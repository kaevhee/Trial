    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h5> Hey, i'm kaweng pam! A student of code plateau 3.0 training program and i'm excited to be a part of this group.Outside code plateau, I love exploring new places, trying different types of food, watching Anime, being a volunteer to the human race and most especially learning new things and that's why code plateau is a great environment for me.
    so far in code plateau, i'm finally getting settled and accustomed to the new things i'm learning from the dedicated teachers along with my fellow comrades. I aspire to learn more as i proceed on this amazing journey with code plateau.</h5>
